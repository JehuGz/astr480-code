# astr480-code
Final Code for Astronomy 480 Final Paper on TOI 4463 and TOI 4463 b.  

I've included the jupyter notebook code and the code inside of a folder that shows how we reduced and calibrated the biases, darks, flats, and science images. Then I've also included how we applied aperture photometry to each image in our folder and the code for plotting the light curve of our target TOI 4463. I've also included code for plotting TOI 4463's model curve based on parameters on the star and the exo-planet.
